Assignment Overview
This project aims to design and implement a scalable backend system using Node.js and MongoDB. The focus is on building a minimal yet functional system for user registration, tweet posting, user authentication with JWT, and fetching user timelines with cursor-based pagination. The design principles include scalability, performance, maintainability, and Domain-Driven Design (DDD).

How to Run the Application
Prerequisites
Node.js
MongoDB


Steps to Set Up and Run Locally
Clone the Repository

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/twitter-backend.git
cd twitter-backend
Install Dependencies

bash
Copy code
npm install
Configure Environment Variables
Create a .env file in the root directory and add the following:

makefile
Copy code
MONGO_URI=your_mongoDB_connection_string
JWT_SECRET=your_secret_key
Run the Application

bash
Copy code
npm start
Access the API
The server will start on http://localhost:3000. Use Postman or a similar tool to interact with the API endpoints.

Dependencies
express: Web framework for Node.js
mongoose: MongoDB object modeling tool
bcryptjs: Library for hashing passwords
jsonwebtoken: Library for JWT authentication
body-parser: Middleware to parse incoming request bodies
Installation Instructions
Install Node.js: Download and install Node.js from the official website.
Install MongoDB: Follow the instructions on the official MongoDB website to install and run MongoDB.
Install Dependencies: Navigate to the project directory and run npm install to install all necessary dependencies.
Configuration
Ensure you have a MongoDB connection string and a secret key for JWT. These should be placed in a .env file in the root directory.

Example .env file:

makefile
Copy code
MONGO_URI=your_mongoDB_connection_string
JWT_SECRET=your_secret_key
Testing
Manual Testing: Use Postman to test the API endpoints.

User Registration: POST /api/users/register
User Login: POST /api/users/login
Post a Tweet: POST /api/tweets
Fetch User Timeline: GET /api/users/:userId/timeline
Automated Tests: If applicable, run tests using:

bash
Copy code
npm test
Issues and Troubleshooting
MongoDB Connection Issues: Ensure MongoDB is running and the connection string in the .env file is correct.
JWT Authentication Errors: Verify that the JWT secret key in the .env file matches the key used in the application.
Server Errors: Check server logs for detailed error messages and stack traces.
